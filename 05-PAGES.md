# Step 5 — Pages / routes (App Router)

## Files added
- `src/app/page.tsx` — landing page: reads searchParams → passes into calculator
- `src/app/save/page.tsx` — deeper proof visuals
- `src/app/how-it-works/page.tsx` — long-form explanation with dynamic callout

## Behavior
- Landing page: calculator runs immediately (QR traffic expects instant utility).
- Links keep the state consistent across pages and preserve UTM params.
