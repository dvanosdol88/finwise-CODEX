# Developer Handoff — Finwise-based Landing + Calculator + Save Proof + How It Works

## Target UX (single scroll, no carousel)
1. Hero headline: “What would you do with $X?”
2. Interactive calculator + chart
3. Scroll sections: Upgrade → Improve → Save
4. Footer with ADV/disclosures
5. Separate pages:
   - `/save` (deeper proof visuals)
   - `/how-it-works` (long-form explanation)

## Stack (to match Finwise template)
- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- `next/font/google` (Inter)
- Recharts (charts)

This package includes all code files needed to drop into a Finwise template repo.
