# Upgrade. Improve. Save.

A high-conversion marketing landing page for a flat-fee financial advisory service ($100/mo). The goal is to show users exactly how much they lose to traditional 1% advisory fees over time.

**Live Site:** [you-are-paying-too-much.com](https://you-are-paying-too-much.com)

## About the Project

This is a Next.js application designed to capture leads through education and interactive tools. Rather than relying on traditional marketing tactics, the site empowers users to calculate their own potential savings, creating a transparent and trust-building experience.

The core value proposition: Why pay 1% of your portfolio annually when you can get the same quality advice for a flat $100/month?

## Key Features

### Interactive Savings Calculator

The centerpiece of the landing page is a dynamic fee comparison calculator where users input:

- **Portfolio Value** — Current investment amount
- **Advisory Fee** — Their current fee percentage (default: 1%)
- **Growth Rate** — Expected annual return
- **Time Horizon** — Investment timeline in years

The calculator generates an interactive Recharts visualization comparing:
- **Projected Portfolio Value** (with flat-fee advisory)
- **Value Lost to Fees** (with traditional percentage-based fees)

All calculator parameters are stored in URL query strings, enabling shareable/bookmarkable projections.

### The Three Pillars

The homepage highlights three core benefits, each leading to its own detailed sub-page:

| Pillar | Route | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Upgrade Your Advice** | `/upgrade` | Modern, fiduciary financial planning with CFA/CFP credentials |
| **Improve Your Tools** | `/improve` | Better data, technology, and portfolio analytics |
| **Save a TON of Money** | `/save` | The flat-fee value proposition with concrete savings projections |

Each pillar has multiple variant pages (`/upgrade1`, `/upgrade2`, etc.) for A/B testing different messaging approaches.

### How It Works

The `/how-it-works` page explains the portfolio replica process:

1. **Analysis** — Review your current holdings and fee structure
2. **Replication** — Recreate your portfolio strategy at a fraction of the cost
3. **Transition** — Seamless migration with tax-loss harvesting opportunities
4. **Ongoing Management** — Continuous monitoring for $100/month flat fee

### Philosophy Pages

The `/meaning` and `/meaning1` pages articulate the firm's philosophy using Jensen Huang's "Task vs. Meaning" framework—separating the mechanical tasks of wealth management (automated) from the meaningful human advisory work (what you actually pay for).
